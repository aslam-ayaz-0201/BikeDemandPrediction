# Bike Demand Prediction

This repository contains the code and analysis for predicting the demand for shared bikes. The goal of this project is to model the demand based on various independent features to assist bike-sharing businesses, like BoomBikes, in making data-driven decisions and optimizing their services for the future.

## Repository Structure

- **`Ayaz-Aslam-Linear-Regression-Bike-Sharing-Assignment.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and analysis.
- **`Ayaz Aslam - Regression+Subjective+Questions.docx.pdf`**: A PDF document containing answers to the subjective questions posed for this project.
- **`README.md`**: This file provides an overview of the project and how to run the code.

## Business Goals

This project aims to model the demand for shared bikes, which can help businesses understand the factors influencing bike demand. By doing so, companies like BoomBikes can tailor their strategies to optimize for future demand, especially after disruptions such as the Covid-19 pandemic. The model can also help BoomBikes understand demand dynamics in new markets.

## Installation Instructions

To run the code in this repository, make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using `pip`:
